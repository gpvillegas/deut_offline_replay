# Brief: This shell script replays the raw (.dat) files 
#        and outputs the raw (.root) files. The leaf
#        variables to be written are specified under 
#        DEF-files/deut_{replay_type}.def and may be modified.
#        Where {replay_type} can be either production where only
#        necessary leaf variables are written for doing physics analysis,
#        or calibration (i.e., "optics", "hodcalib", "dccalib", "calcalib", "scalers",
#        "reftime", "timewin")

# What type of input is {replay_type} ?
# Answer: {replay_type} is an input based on the suffix of a symbolic link made to this shell script.
# For examlpe, if a symbolic link is made:  ln -sf UTILS_DEUT/offline_scripts/replay_deut.sh replay_deut_suffix.sh
# then the {replay_type} becomes "suffix".  This way, there exists ONLY this shell script, from which different
# shell scripts can be linked to, and based on the "suffix", then a different part of this shell script would be executed

# example 1: create a production replay script (replay raw data file with all leaf variables)
# ln -sf  UTILS_DEUT/offline_scripts/replay_deut.sh replay_deut_prod.sh

# example 2:  create calibration replay script (replay raw data file with only leaf variabled relevant to calibration)
# ln -sf  UTILS_DEUT/offline_scripts/replay_deut.sh replay_deut_hodcalib.sh

# Which replay type are we doing? physics analysis ("prod"), or calibration ("hodcalib", "dccalib", "calcalib", "scalers", "reftime", "timewin")
#replay_type=${0##*_}
#replay_type=${replay_type%%.sh}

# --- GV CHANGES ---
# replay script naming convention: replay_deut_{replay_type}-{replay_mode}.sh
# I added replay_mode in order to easily be able to pick a replay script for single arm, coin, or other types of runs that might need different datafiles.
